\ch{C}So, so you think you can \ch{D}tell,\\
Heaven from \ch{Ami}Hell, blue skys from \ch{G}pain.\\
Can you tell A,green \ch{D}field from A,cold steel \ch{C}rail, A,smile from A,\ch{Am}veil,\\
Do you think you can \ch{G}tell?\\

And did they get you to \ch{C}trade your heroes for \ch{D}ghosts,\\
Hot ashes for \ch{Ami}trees, hot air for A,cool \ch{G}breeze, cold comfort for \ch{D}change, \\
And did you ex\ch{C}change A,walk on part in the \ch{Ami}war \\
for \ch{A},lead role in \ch{A},\ch{G}cage?\\

\ch{C}How I wish, how I wish you were \ch{D}here.\\
We're just \ch{Ami}two lost souls swimming in A,fish bowl, \ch{G}year after year,\\
\ch{D}Running over the same old ground. What \ch{C}have we found?\\
The same old \ch{Ami}fears. Wish you were \ch{G}here!\\
